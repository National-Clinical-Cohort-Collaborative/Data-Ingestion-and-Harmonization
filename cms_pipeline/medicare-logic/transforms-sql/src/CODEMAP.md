* from Daniel Moran @ Acumen  5/5/2023
Chris, for all revenue code arrays, the basis of the array is formed around the revenue code. This provides the basic information of the service provided. 
The HCPCS may provide additional information about the service and the revenue date may provide information about the specific timing of the service. 
So certain revenue codes are expected to have a revenue date and a HCPCS service while others would likely have neither. This also varies by setting. 
Outpatient will regularly have HCPCS and revenue dates because its paid closer to the line level. SNF services are more general and span the entire claim 
so often miss both HCPCS and date. A few examples:
0001 is an accounting line for total charges and wonâ€™t have a HCPCS or revenue date
0022 marks the field as including a HIPPS code for SNF. The HIPPS code will be in the HCPCS field and the revenue date the initiation of that HIPPS level
0120 represents supplying a room for the claim. This service needs neither a revenue date nor HCPCS to provide additional information
0450 represents emergency room services in, for example, outpatient services. This is expected to have HCPCS and revenue date indicating the specific 
      service and date
So I would not exclude lines missing a HCPCS or revenue date. They can contain important information even if they lack specifics. If you want to identify 
specific pieces such as HIPPS, I would identify them through the revenue codes. A full list of codes can be found here:

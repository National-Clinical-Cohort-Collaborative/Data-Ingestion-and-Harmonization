# Data Ingest and Harmonization Workstream
Welcome to the National COVID/Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Ingest and Harmonization Workstream.   This workstream receives datasets from the Phenotype and Data Acquistion Workstream, which are data in one of four common data model (CDM) formats (PEDSNet, OMOP, ACT, PCORNet, or TriNetX) from each contributing site.  A series of data quality checks and transformation into OMOP 5.3.1 follow, as outlined in [Workflows](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/data-ingest-and-harmonization/tree/master/Workflows). 

A parellel body of work to create the generic maps between three of the CDMs and OMOP 5.3.1. These maps will be published and validated as spreadsheets format.
